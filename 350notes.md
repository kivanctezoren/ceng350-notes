# CH1 â€“ Introduction

* **Software:** Computer programs & associated documentation

* **Software engineering:** concerned with theories, methods, tools for software development
    * Fundamental activities: software specification, development, validation, evolution
    * A part of system engineering (hardware + software + process engineering)

* Often: Software costs > computer system / hardware cost

* Software maintenance cost > development cost

* Software products: "Generic" or "customized"

* Essential attributes of good software:
    * **Maintainability:** Critical attribute. To be able to evolve with changing needs

    * **Dependablity:** Security, reliability, safety. Should not cause damage in case of failure

    * **Efficiency**

    * **Acceptability:** Compatible with other systems, understandable, usable

## Application Types

### Stand-alone
* Run on a local machine (e.g a PC).
* Need not to be connected to a network
* Has all required functionality

### Interactive transaction-based
* Accessed by users externally, runs on remote computer
* Web app.s (e.g e-commerce app.s)

### Embedded control systems
* Controls and manages HW

### Batch processing systems
* Processes individual inputs in large batches

### Data collection systems
* Collect data using sensors, send to other systems to process

### Entertainment systems

### Modelling & simulation systems
* Developed by scientists & engineers for modeling
* Usually includes many separate interacting objects

### Systems of systems
* Composed of other software systems

---

* Web-based systems: Distributed & complex. Need "agile development": impractical to specify all the requirements for such systems in advance.

* Service-oriened systems: All components considered as replaceable services. Allows rapid configurations & incremental updates as new services become available.
